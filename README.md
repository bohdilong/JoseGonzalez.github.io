## Pizza Menu<br>
This project is a menu used to order pizza with a various selection of toppings.<br> 
It then takes the input information and calculates a pricefor the order.

## Tic-Tac-Toe Game<br>
The classic game of tic tac toe. It randomly rolls dice to select which of the two players goes first<br>
and then users are off playing the classic game. Users can decide which token each player wants to use and <br>
the winner is celebrated with music and flashing lights.

## Calculator
A basic Four function calculator. Users can add, subtract, multiply, and divide<br>
on a sleek web version of a calculator.
